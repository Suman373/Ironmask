## Iron Man Mask

Idea: Ever since I was introduced to superhero movies, the first genuine superhero(human) I loved was Tony Stark. A man in the Iron Suit, no not really. Take that off and he is a Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist..and a dad figure to a neighbourhood spiderman too XD.
MCU is grateful to a person like him who sacrificed his life for saving trillions more. Indeed, he is the "Iron Man". We love you 3000 Mr.Stark.
